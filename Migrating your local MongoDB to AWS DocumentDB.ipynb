    "- 1) okay look yeah you're going to need an AWS account, this shit ain't free (well the free stuff is free but documentDB doesn't have a free tier) - (writing this after my first day of docDB charges and damn re-reading this hurt my soul) \n",
    "- 2) Access, AWS handles access through the IAM - Identity and Access Manager. You will need to create a new user and add the appropriate policies to it. AmazonDocDBFullAccess.\n",
    "- 3) Create a VPC for your documentDB \n",
    "- 4) Create an EC2 instance \n",
    "    - why? okay so heres the annoying part about using documentDB it can only interact with other aws services within the same vpc. \n",
    "    - what does that mean for you? (or me) - well it means uploading the data from my local mongoDB is going to be a pain and we're going to use the EC2 instance as a sort of intermediary between us and documentDB\n",
    "    \n",
    "- 5) Create a security group so that your EC2 instance can actually connect to your documentDB\n",
    "- 6) Create your DocumentDB cluster\n",
    "- 7) Connect your EC2 instance to your Document DB cluster\n",
    "- 8) Install the Mongo Shell on your EC2 instance\n",
    "- 9) Manage TLS \n",
    "- 10) Test Connection with mongo shell \n",
    "- 11) Install Jupyter notebooks and pymongo on EC2 instance \n",
    "- 12) SCP your local CSV file to your EC2 instance\n",
    "- 13) insert your data into documentDB w chunksize probably since you'll be choosing a cheap instance"
