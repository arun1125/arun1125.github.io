# Sequence Prediction 



This is either the first in a series (1/n) or a very very long notebook on sequence prediction. 

Why? Great Question!, I need to learn it for work and I don't really know anything about it, YET

This notebook will probably act as a conversation from me to me, hopefully you appreciate this style of writing because I haven't figured that stuff out yet either

## Initial Questions

* What is sequence prediction?
* What is my main goal trying when doing sequence predictions?
* How is the Problem Formulated?
* What are the current popular techniques for solving these problems?
* What were they previously and why aren't they popular anymore (we learn through counter factuals)
