# About

Hi! My name is Arun, I currently work as a Data Scientist in Canada. I graduated with a degree in Mathematics from the University of Warwick. Actually, it's more like, I dropped out of my masters to work in Canada after winning an award. This blog will be used to describe my pursuits; academic, philosophic and pyschedelic.
