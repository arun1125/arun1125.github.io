## Who am I? 

Good Question! My Name is Arunachalam Thirunavukkarasu, that's a bit of a mouthful so everyone calls me Arun. I'm currently a Data Scientist in Toronto but I was educated in the UK where I did my undergrad in Mathematics at the University of Warwick. I had planned on continuing my studies with my Masters lined up however during the summer of 2018, between my undergrad and masters, I completed an internship at RBC in the UK. Long story short my team won a competition and (with the help of some liquid courage at the after party) I asked the CTO if I could work in Toronto. This set of a chain of events which led to me dropping out of my masters and moving to Toronto, Canada to become a Data Scientist! Maybe I'll go finish 'professionally' studying one day but right now this blog is a place for me to word vommit what I've learned trolling through the internet.
