## Whats going on here? 

Good Question! My Name is Arunachalam Thirunavukkarasu, that's a bit of a mouthful so everyone calls me Arun. Welcome to my website, The Data Digressive! No idea why but you can subscribe to get articles at a rate I have yet to determine. This website is for me to write about topics I find interesting or anything I have learned about recently. Primarily; Statistics, Maths, Computer Science and anything that intersects this trifecta. However, and this is where the digressive part comes in, I write about food, pyschadellics and my travel experiences too! 

## Background about me

Currently I'm a Data Scientist in Toronto. Educated and raised in the UK. Born in India. 
I did my undergrad in Mathematics at the University of Warwick where I had planned on continuing my studies by pursuing a Masters. However, I got a job offer following an internsip I completed that summer of 2018 and when I had the option of moving to another country I said _fuck_ it i'm dropping out and moving.
